<p class="left"> Here are some projects that I have finished in the past. </p><br>
<ul>
<li> EasyPaint </li> 
<li> s3fs-fuse encryption and decryption</li> 
<li> Data Structure </li> 
<li>Technical Report </li> 
</ul> 


<p class="left"> EasyPaint - in easypaint the whole structure of the software has been designed already. My main goals/focus was to add new 
features and functionality to the software. The software was written in C++ using QT Framework. Some new functionality that was added wasthe ability
to draw dash lines in the paint canvas. Also I added a function that allowed double left and right click on the palatte bar to pick a primary or 
secondary color.

<ul>
<li>Debugging</li>
<li>Knowledge of QT Framework</li> 
<li>C++</li> 
</ul> 


<p class="left">s3fs-fuse encryption and decryption - in this project I downloaded the source code from the github account of the s3fs-fuse authors. 
The original source code allowed for a user to upload and download documents to Amazon S3 storage when s3fs-fuse is mounted on a bucket on your local 
linux client. My main purpose was to modify the source code to encrypt any files that were to be uploaded into S3. Another purpose of the project was to auto
decrypt any files that are downloaded from my S3 bucket. My encryption algorithm that is used in the project is Rc4.

<p class="left"> Data Structure - for this project I learned about the data structure in a software. These structures ranges from trees, linked list,
stacks, queues, and dynamic arrays. I used C++ for programming each structures.
